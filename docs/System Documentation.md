## 1. Introduction

Moodle is an online site that allows you to create online study courses accessible to everyone or whoever you want.
We have used Moodle Cloud, the difference of the previous one is that it is free but with a limited number of storage and users.
In addition, the moodle site can also be accessed from a mobile phone through the free downloadable application

## 2. Creation of a course

Before you can create a course you must log in to the site as a professor so we have the appropriate permissions to create a course.
Entering the site at the top right we will find the image of a gear.
After clicking it we will be asked to activate the editing mode.
Then press the gear again and the create course section will appear.

## 3. Creation of a lesson

After creating a course, you can create one or more lessons within the course. 
The procedures for creating a lesson are very similar to those for creating a course.
Press the gear figure at the top right of the site and activate the editing mode
Then select the option create a lessons.
After these steps you will have created a lesson, also inside the lessons you can insert intermediate quizzes and make sure that if the student answers correctly he can continue with the lesson, or he will have to repeat the previous parts and repeat the intermediate quiz.

## 4. System Maintenance

If you use moodlecloud you have to keep an eye on it to factors.
One of these is storage, in fact moodlecloud being the free version offers limited storage, the same is true for the number of users.
In addition, the courses created, the lessons and whether the tests continue to function correctly must be reviewed.
Finally, the user registration procedure must be kept under review, that is, it must be identified whether the user who is enrolling or is logging in is a student or a professor, this because subsequently the rights will be assigned to him / her on the site.
