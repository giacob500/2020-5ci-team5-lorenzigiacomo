# 1Introduction

The Moodle platform has given the possibility to our team to create an English course in a very short time, precisely because it is an IT environment for course management. Project constraints will be included in separate documentation. The Software Project Management Plan will give specifics on project budget and schedule. A separate Test Plan document will address test specifications and procedures.
