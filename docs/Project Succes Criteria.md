# Success Criteria for &quot;SAAS: the new frontier of learning&quot; Project

The SAAS project will be considered a success if . . .

**A fully functional test system is delivered on or before 25/05/2019.**

The system shall be delivered in a state that is ready to be used in its intended production environment for its intended purpose. The users must be able to use a platform where they can increase their English language skills and learn from our lessons in a simple and intuitive manner.

**Concerns raised during the test period are addressed according to the problem resolution plan contained in the Software Project Management Plan**

All critical defects found before May 25th will be fixed. A critical defect is one for which there is no convenient workaround. Changes that take longer will be considered immediately. Minor errors will be changed later with the help of supervisors.

**ITI Guglielmo Marconi&#39;s students can easily log into the system.**

This specifically means that students of the school will be able to login into the system, choose their english course and start learning with this.

**SAAS supervisors can edit courses.**

All system administrators and supervisors are able to edit, delete and publish new courses, exercises, surveys and much more. Of course administrators can also manage system users.

**The production database is updated.**

The system database is managed automatically by the &quot;MoodleCloud&quot; platform.

**Developers and supervisors have documented the schedule information**

The data on the report should accurately reflect what was actually done during the development period.
