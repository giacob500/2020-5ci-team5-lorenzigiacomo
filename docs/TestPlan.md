# INTRODUCTION

This exercise essentially was to produce an online English course to help students who have difficulties in the grammar of the English language.

## Test Specifications

During the development of the software, the tester of our group which is: Matteo Olivieri has performed several tests, above all to verify the integration of the product. Later, when the product was almost completed, a group of students not belonging to our group, but who were potential users of our course, tried our final product and reported any errors. The complete testing procedures are outlined in the test specifications document.

## Test Reports

After some pupils tested our course they reported us some errors which were: some grammatical errors and some wrong answers in the final tests of some lessons.

After we were told that our product had these problems, we immediately intervened to correct them and within a few days we corrected them all since they were few and easy to solve.

## Project Plan

The pupils tested our project on May 10, 2019 but they reported the problems to us in three days, that is, on May 13th. We solve this problems in one week so we finish all the project on May 20, 2019 but even now we are available in case a user reveals a problem.

## Quality Assurance Plan

The quality assurance plan is well beacouse we had students, who may be possible users of this platform, test our product and after the first test where some errors were reported but we quickly resolved them, after the second test they reported that our course is very good for the average level of students of our age.

# APPROACH

## Strategy

The testing approach includes that each member of the group, in particular the tester who is Matteo Olivieri, carries out the action of simulating access to the online course created by us and testing all its functions since the course was created for our level of English and therefore we too could be possible users of our product.

## Techniques/Tools

All members of the group will have to test all the features of our course and report every slightest error so that they can be resolved before publishing the finished product.

Furthermore, however, our group is always available in case a user encounters an error.

## Test Goals

The objectives of these tests are to find and in case resolve any errors of various kinds present in our online course prior to making it available to all users who are allowed to access. The ultimate goal is to offer an online course to learn some grammar rules in English without errors of any kind
